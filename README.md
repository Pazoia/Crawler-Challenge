# Crawler Challenge

## Steps I took and how I approached the challenge

↦ Create a virtual env to keep dependencies and their versions isolated from local machine

```
python3 -m venv crawler
```

↦ Activate virtual env

```
source crawler/bin/activate
```

↦ Install dependencies in Pipfile
I used the command below as I had already activate the `crawler` environment

```
pipenv sync
```
